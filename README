Description:   Tools for accessing Amiga file system images in Java

About this project
------------------

This is a collection of software tools to access Amiga file systems.
At the core is a file system library written in Scala.
I started to write this because I wanted to use my Mac to prepare
a couple of ADF files for testing on UAE.

Usage
-----
You can simply download the latest version of the adf-browser jar
from github and start it with

java -jar adf-browser-<date>.jar

Building
--------
The project can be either built with maven or with sbt.
The library is in the adf-core module, the browser application
is in the adf-gui module.

Status
------
- supports Double Density disks
- supports OFS and FFS
- can create disks
- can add files to a disk
- rename files/directories/disk, move files between directories
- delete files (non-destructive)
- can copy files from a disk
- view icons from .info files
- stretch icons to display adapt aspect ratio
- 1.3 and 2.0 palettes for icon display

Background
----------
The ADF C library does not compile correctly on my machine and I needed
a Java library to access ADF files anyways, so I just started to work
on it.

The file system specifications were taken from

Ralph Babel's Amiga Guru Book, chapters 9, 10 and 15
Data Becker Amiga Intern, chapter 3.8
