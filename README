Description:   Tools for accessing Amiga file system images in Java

About this project
------------------

This is a collection of software tools to access Amiga file systems.
At the core is a file system library written in Scala.
I started to write this because I wanted to use my Mac to prepare
a couple of ADF files for testing on UAE.

Background
----------
The ADF C library does not compile correctly on my machine and I needed
a Java library to access ADF files anyways, so I just started to work
on it.

The file system specifications were taken from

Ralph Babel's Amiga Guru Book, chapters 9, 10 and 15
